## Rules for If-Statements
1. Every if-Statement must have an else.
2. If the "else" should never run, then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies. 
3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
4. Treat if-statement like paragraphs.
5. Boolean tests should be simple. If  they are complex, move the calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name.

## Rules for loops

1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever, that means probably never.
2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.

## Tips for Debugging

1. Do not use **"debugger"**.
2. The best way is to use **print** to check the values of variables.
3. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Do not write massive files of code before you try to run them.
